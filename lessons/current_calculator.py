#Given voltage and resistance inputs (strings), convert to numbers and compute current (I = V/R).

#steps
#map thru the data and ensure they are in the correct type, int
#get the voltages
#get the resistance values
#perform I=V/R

#zip() pairs elements from two or more iterables together by their indexes
#re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)- checks if the str has matches then replaces it with what is specified and returns a stristrng
