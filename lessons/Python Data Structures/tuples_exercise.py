#  tuple - collection of different data types which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable)
# creating an empty tuple: empty_tuple = () or empty_tuple = tuple()
# last_index =len(fruits) - 1. postive indexing  & negative indexing
# slicing tpl[start: end]
# indexing: tple.index(item), tpl[0]
# if we want to modify a tuple we should change it to a list
# lst = list(tple_example)
# counting
# checking if an item is there : 'item2' in tpl
# Since tuples are ordered, they allow duplicates as they can be differentiated by their index.
# joining tuples tpl3 = tpl1 + tpl2
# deleting del tpl
# unpacking when unpacking unpack everything
