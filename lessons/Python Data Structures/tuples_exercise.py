#  tuple - collection of different data types which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable)
# creating an empty tuple: empty_tuple = () or empty_tuple = tuple()
# last_index =len(fruits) - 1. postive indexing  & negative indexing
# slicing
#  if we want to modify a tuple we should change it to a list
# lst = list(tple_example)
# checking if an item is there : 'item2' in tpl
# joining tuples tpl3 = tpl1 + tpl2
# deleting del tpl
